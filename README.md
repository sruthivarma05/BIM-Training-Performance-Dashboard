# BIM-Training-Performance-Dashboard
An analysis of product demand, revenue, and sales performance across training courses and locations.
 The main objective was to support data-driven 
decision-making in BIM workforce planning by analyzing training performance and regional demand trends 
using Power BI. The project focused on creating an interactive dashboard that visualizes KPIs such as 
enrollments, revenue, call activity, and training model preferences. 
The data used in this project was collected from three branches—Arizona, Texas, and California—covering 
a 12-month period. It included over 1,300 records with fields related to training enrollments, fees paid, 
revenue, and advertising. I cleaned and merged the datasets using Excel and Power BI, removed 
inconsistencies, and ensured standardized formats. The dashboard highlighted trends such as the popularity 
of Excavator training, the revenue leadership of the Arizona branch, and fluctuations in enrollments over 
time. 
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in transforming raw data into actionable insights. I 
learned to use Power BI for visualization, improved my data cleaning techniques, and strengthened my 
ability to interpret real-world business data. This internship also enhanced my communication and 
teamwork skills, as I regularly interacted with the BIM team to understand goals and deliver results. 
Overall, the experience contributed significantly to my growth as a data science student.
tools used-
Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data cleaning, merging monthly reports, and removing 
inconsistencies like null values, incorrect formats, and inconsistent labels. 
● Microsoft Power BI: The main tool used to import datasets, transform data using Power 
Query, model relationships between tables, and design visual dashboards.
